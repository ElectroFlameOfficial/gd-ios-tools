# iOS Patch for Geometry Dash
---
 This was made to help guide you thru the installation process of the Geometry Dash iOS patch. If this looks really choppy, it really is because this was written on a school night and was rushed. I will certainly update this when I get the chance though.

---
###### abridged explanation of issue
---
Some instances of Geometry Dash installed on iOS 15.2 and later have been preventing launch due to an issue caused by how everyplay was being initialized. This is because everyplay was clearly (and sadly) killed a few years ago. This patch disables everyplay in favor of allowing players to play Geometry Dash on their devices once again. Everyplay's functionality can be substituted by iOS' internal recorder.

## Installation instructions
---
###### Prerequisites: 
- an iPhone running iOS 15.2 or later
- an iCloud account
- a PC
- AltStore (or any program/app that allows you to sideload IPAs)
- [Patched IPA File](https://drive.protonmail.com/urls/V73JMQK7JW#cqK8ES6v3sAp) to sideload
- ---
###### Step 1: download the patched IPA File
use the redirect up in [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) or the [direct link](https://github.com/ElectroFlameOfficial/gd-ios-tools/releases/download/iOS-Patch-Prerelease/2.1-iOS-fix.ipa) to install the patched file.

---
###### Step 2: set up Sideloader
---
###### NOTE: Although other software like [sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) will work just fine, I heavily suggest using [AltStore](https://altstore.io) as it's really reliable (from my experience).

Since this is sorta rushed I'll just redirect you to [this](https://beebom.com/how-sideload-apps-iphone/) handy guide (this patch writeup was written on a school night)

`~ WARNING: If you have experience with sideloading and are comfortable with doing it on your own, you can skip this step. If you DO NOT have experience with this, PLEASE don't skip this step as you might end up breaking something on your device. Please note that you need to install iTunes and iCloud directly from apple -- NOT from the Microsoft Store -- if you're using Windows 10 for this. ~`

###### Step 3: Launch Geometry Dash
---
To confirm that everything works, try launching geometry dash. If it works, congrats! you installed everything properly. If it doesn't, please reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/poweredbyelectr) or discord at Electro#8628.
